With market research - Validate before you build—ensure there’s a real user pain Start narrow and expand only after you have strong user pull.

	⁃	Focus on actionable next steps, and test assumptions with real users as soon as possible.
	⁃	The user provides a full, complex conceptual business idea, or
	⁃	The user provides a video URL link from YouTube, or
	⁃	The user provides a web URL link for any https://
	⁃	Transcribe on an as needed basis (video URLs)

	⁃	The solutions should take action on the easiest, least friction, niche, high demand, low solution of supply market
	⁃	The easiest, least friction, niche, high demand, low solution of supply market is also known as the ‘lowest hanging fruit’
	⁃	This master prompt assignment aims to create a blueprint for a functional, mirrored version of the technical concepts illustrated in the video
	⁃	The focus is on the agent architecture for managing memory and context
	⁃	The video illustrates the shift from basic prompt engineering to context engineering
	⁃	The video outlines three types of memory (Working, Short-Term/Session, and Long-Term/Database) within an AI Agent flow for an e-commerce (pet shop) application
	⁃	The ContextualAgent is the core AI orchestrator that receives user input, determines tool use, and generates final responses
	⁃	The SessionManager manages the conversation history (chat buffer) and maintains the currently relevant contextual subset of long-term data
	⁃	The LongTermMemoryDB stores persistent user data (preferences, orders, profiles) and system rules (tool efficiency/constraints)
	⁃	Long-Term Memory
	⁃	ToolExecutor
	⁃	Executes external functions, specifically querying the product catalog based on semantic search.

	⁃	System Memory

	⁃	**Coordinated Prompt Sequence**
	⁃	The goal is to simulate the video scenario: finding (subject) tools, establishing the “new kitten” fact, and updating the database accordingly, while utilizing memory.

	⁃	P1: Initial Query and Context Retrieval (ContextualAgent)
	⁃	Target Agent: ContextualAgent
	⁃	Goal: Initiate the session, establish the primary goal (kitten supplies), and retrieve contextually relevant long-term memories.
	⁃
	⁃	{
	⁃	“user_id”: “Aja_user_123”,
	⁃	“query”: “I just got a new LLM! What types of tools and protocols should I look for?”
	⁃	}
	⁃	**Instructions for ContextualAgent:**
	⁃
	⁃	1. Initiate a new session for `user_id`.
	⁃	2. Based on the query, request relevant long-term data from the `LongTermMemoryDB` (P2), focusing on pet type (“cat”) and product category (“food”, “toys”).
	⁃	3. Determine the appropriate external function (`ToolExecutor`) needed to fulfill the request.
	⁃	4. Use the retrieved context and the current query to execute the tool search (P3).
	⁃	P2: Long-Term Memory Retrieval (SessionManager/LongTermMemoryDB)
	⁃	Target Agents: SessionManager, LongTermMemoryDB
	⁃	Goal: Pull only relevant user and preference data into the current session context to minimize LLM token usage and maximize relevance.
	⁃	**Instructions for SessionManager:**
	⁃	1. Current Session ID: [Generated Session ID]
	⁃	2. Current Query Intent: Purchase recommendations for new cat/kitten owner (toys, food).
	⁃	3. Query the `LongTermMemoryDB` for attributes related to `user_id` that align with the intent:
	⁃	a. Most recent 3 orders related to “cat” products (for brand/type preference).
	⁃	b. User profile preferences explicitly tagged with “cat.”
	⁃	c. System memories related to “cat” product search tool efficiency.
	⁃	4. Inject the resulting subset of memories (LTM) into the session context for the `ContextualAgent`.
	⁃	P3: Tool Execution (ToolExecutor)
	⁃	Target Agent: ToolExecutor
	⁃	Goal: Use the agent’s full context (P1 query + P2 session data) to perform an efficient, semantically aware search of the product catalog.
	⁃	**Instructions for ToolExecutor:**
	⁃	1. Execute semantic search on product catalog.
	⁃	2. Search terms: “kitten toys”, “kitten food”.
	⁃	3. Semantic filters (derived from SessionManager context): [e.g., preferred brand, age of current pets (if known)].
	⁃	4. Return top 5 relevant product results to the `ContextualAgent`.
	⁃	P4: Long-Term Memory Update & Consolidation (MemoryProcessorLLM)
	⁃	Target Agent: MemoryProcessorLLM
	⁃	Process new information from the session.
	⁃	Summarize the information for permanent storage.
	⁃	Analyze the final conversation transcript and state changes within the given Session ID.
	⁃	Identify new, persistent facts about the user.
	⁃	If the user recently acquired a kitten, note that as a new fact.
	⁃	If the user expressed a preference for a specific brand of food, note that as a new fact.
	⁃	Generate a concise, structured entry for each new fact.
	⁃	Transmit these structured updates to the LongTermMemoryDB for persistence.
	⁃	Store feedback about tool performance.
	⁃	Ensure the agent learns to improve its internal decision flow.
	⁃	Input: Agent execution trace from the given Session ID.
	⁃	Observation: ToolExecutor attempted to use the wrong tool.
	⁃	Action: Create a system constraint memory to avoid using the wrong tool in similar situations unless explicitly requested.
	⁃	Store the constraint memory (Tool Memory) in the `LongTermMemoryDB`.
	⁃	The memory should be stored under the system/tools namespace.
	⁃	The `ContextualAgent` should be able to access this memory during its planning step.
	⁃	Modularity and Separation of Concerns
	⁃	Agent (Orchestration): The ContextualAgent should only handle decision logic, receive input, retrieve necessary context via SessionManager, select tools, and formulate the final response.
	⁃	Session (State): The SessionManager holds the ephemeral, short-term context (conversation history and the small subset of LTM data pulled for immediate use).
	⁃	Database (Persistence): The LongTermMemoryDB must be robust, indexed, and separate. This is where the enduring facts about the user and the system reside.
	⁃	Implementing the Memory Flow
	⁃	The critical architectural leap is showing how LTM data feeds into the session and how the session data updates the LTM.
	⁃	Implement a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) step in the session initiation process.
	⁃	Use the user ID and initial query to perform a semantic search against the LongTermMemoryDB.
	⁃	Prepend the subset of relevant data to the LLM prompt.
	⁃	Implement an asynchronous processing pipeline to update the LongTermMemoryDB after the main conversation is concluded.
	⁃	Pass the entire session transcript to the MemoryProcessorLLM for summarization and structured data conversion.
	⁃	Define the ToolExecutor with clear inputs and outputs.
	⁃	Prompt the ContextualAgent to recognize when to invoke the tool.
	⁃	Store incorrect tool usage as a persistent memory in the SystemContextManager.
	⁃	Allow the agent to refine its tool selection strategy over time.
	⁃	Database:
	⁃	A vector database (e.g., Chroma, Pinecone, or a vector-enabled database like PostgreSQL/Spanner) is ideal for storing the LTM.
	⁃	It is especially useful for semantic searching of user preferences.
	⁃	Agent Framework:
	⁃	Frameworks like LangChain or Google’s Gen AI SDK are excellent for managing the flow between the ContextualAgent, the LLM calls, and the external tools (ToolExecutor).
	⁃	LLM:
	⁃	Utilize a large model (like Gemini or GPT-4) for the main ContextualAgent.
	⁃	A potentially smaller, faster model can be used for the asynchronous, focused task of the MemoryProcessorLLM.
	•	Deliver a precise, temporally aligned transcript and analysis of the video content.

Analyzing the Transformation by First Principles
The transformation of the Park Theater into The Liberty Opry describes a fundamental, multi-stage process involving the decomposition and re-composition of an asset’s core purpose. This is not merely a cosmetic change (like repainting); it is a complete reset of the structure's relationship with its users and the economy, defined by three first principles:
1. The Principle of Structure and State
The foundational element is the physical structure itself, which is temporally independent of its function.
• Initial State (1938-Closure): A contained physical structure optimized for the passive consumption of projected, recorded media (a movie house). Its internal architecture prioritized sightlines to a screen and mass seating for short, transactional visits.
• Intermediate State (Idle Period): The structure temporarily exists in its purest form—a collection of materials and volume, devoid of human function or economic purpose. Its value is only in its material and real estate components.
• Action (Refurbishment): The physical structure is internally reconstructed. The refurbishment represents a re-optimization of the structure to accommodate human performers, musical acoustics, and stagecraft, fundamentally altering the way occupants interact with the space.
2. The Principle of Function (Purpose)
This principle defines what the structure does—the service it provides, which is the most critical change in the transformation.
• Initial Function: To serve as a medium for reproduction, translating stored data (film) into visual and auditory signals for mass audiences. The content is static and replicable.
• New Function: To serve as a platform for live production, hosting unique, non-replicable, human-driven musical entertainment (Branson-style live opry). The new function is centered on the moment-to-moment interaction between performer and audience.
3. The Principle of Operational Model (Ownership)
This principle defines the economic and control mechanism under which the function operates.
• Initial Model: The business model was likely tied to film distribution and ticket sales for copyrighted works.
• Transformation Action (1993 Purchase): The change of ownership by the Cox family represents the introduction of a new, singular vision and intention into the idle structure. This new ownership model shifted the business focus from distributing third-party content to creating and producing original, proprietary content (The Liberty Opry show).
The transformation process, therefore, is the synergistic application of a new Vision (Ownership) upon an existing Structure to enable a completely redefined Function, transitioning the building from a passive cinema medium to an active live performance platform
