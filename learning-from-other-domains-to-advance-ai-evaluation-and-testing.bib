 	Synthesizing insights from the eight case studies, also published separately, and
extracting lessons relevant to AI (Part 1);
 	Surveying key multistakeholder initiatives that are driving AI evaluation science and
practice forward (Part 2); and

testing ecosystem and strengthen AI governance (Part 3)},
